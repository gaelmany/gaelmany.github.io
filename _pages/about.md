After graduating from a Master degree in Marine Geosciences and Aquatic Environments from the University of Perpignan, I obtained my PhD from the same university at <a href="https://cefrem.univ-perp.fr/">CEFREM</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cefrem.univ-perp.fr/index.php/personnel/2-non-categorise/66-durrieu">Xavier Durrieu de Madron</a> and <a href="https://cefrem.univ-perp.fr/index.php/personnel/27-chercheurs/65-francois">Francois Bourrin</a>. I was then a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.shom.fr/">SHOM</a> (Brest) in Frederic Jourdinâ€™s group, and at the University of Toulouse Sabatier in Caroline Ulsesâ€™ group (<a href="https://www.legos.omp.eu/">LEGOS</a>). I then moved to Lausanne to take up a post-doc position at the <a href="https://www.unil.ch/index.html">University of Lausanne</a> in 2021, where I was a post-doctoral researcher in limnology in <a href="https://www.unil.ch/gse/fr/home/menuinst/vie-facultaire/promotions--nominations/perga-marie-elodie.html">Marie-Elodie Perga</a>'s group (<a href="https://wp.unil.ch/lakes/">LAKES</a>). I am now working as a post-doc at <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/fr/">EAWAG</a> in <a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/surf/main-focus/remote-sensing/">Daniel Odermatt</a>'s group.  

My research interests revolve around marine / aquatic environments dynamics. I use a combination of existing measurement platforms and models to study physical and biogeochemical processes. I am interested in studying the coastal ocean and lakes behavior during short-term events such as river floods and marine storms. I am focused on the monitoring of the impact of such events on the water dynamics, sediment transport and properties, and on the primary production variability.


I am currently working on the monitoring of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) from satellite, applied to small alpine lakes. The main objective is to estimate the feasibility of such monitoring for the different ECVs on small alpine lakes using current satellite missions (Landsat, Sentinel, SWOT). This works also encompasses an estimate of alternative spatiotemporal resolution requirements for small alpine lakes, and corresponding uncertainty and stability requirements that could be required in the future.
